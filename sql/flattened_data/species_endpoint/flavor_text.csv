tree stump. The roots of the stump follow its
direction in battle.",en,sword

becomes the boss of the troop. It has a gentle
disposition and values harmony among its group.",en,shield

coursing through this Pokémon’s body. Once that
happens, it’s ready to fight at full power.",en,sword

one on its nose. Once it’s raring to fight, these
pads radiate tremendous heat.",en,shield

814,"It kicks berries right off the branches of trees
and then juggles them with its feet, practicing
its footwork.",en,shield
815,"It juggles a pebble with its feet, turning it into a
burning soccer ball. Its shots strike opponents
hard and leave them scorched.",en,sword
815,"It’s skilled at both offense and defense, and it
gets pumped up when cheered on. But if it starts
showboating, it could put itself in a tough spot.",en,shield

the chemical punch of 100 onions, and attackers

it were camouflaged.",en,shield

water balloons created with moisture secreted

weak points so it can precisely blast them with
water that shoots from its fingertips at Mach 3.",en,shield
819,"Found throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon
becomes uneasy if its cheeks are ever completely
empty of berries.",en,sword

it more resilient than it looks. It’ll show up on
farms, searching for yet more berries.",en,shield

they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit
slow-witted, so it doesn’t notice the loss.",en,sword

Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew

Pokémon very successfully act as the Galar
region’s airborne taxi service.",en,shield

824,"Often found in gardens, this Pokémon has hairs
on its body that it uses to assess its surroundings.",en,shield

prepare for evolution.",en,shield

what’s around it—and what’s around it can
include things over six miles away.",en,shield
827,"Aided by the soft pads on its feet, it silently raids
the food stores of other Pokémon. It survives off
its ill-gotten gains.",en,sword
827,"Cunning and cautious, this Pokémon survives by
stealing food from others. It erases its tracks with
swipes of its tail as it makes off with its plunder.",en,shield
828,"It secretly marks potential targets with a scent.
By following the scent, it stalks its targets
and steals from them when they least expect it.",en,sword
828,"With a lithe body and sharp claws, it goes
around stealing food and eggs. Boltund
is its natural enemy.",en,shield

this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right
back up at the bottom, unharmed.",en,sword

able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this

coal. Fittingly, this Pokémon was first discovered
in coal mines about 400 years ago.",en,sword

rocky terrain. Burning coal sustains it.",en,shield
838,"It forms coal inside its body. Coal dropped by

18 mph. The temperature of the flames it
breathes exceeds 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit.",en,shield

839,"While it’s engaged in battle, its mountain of coal

scorch the surrounding area.",en,shield
840,"It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides
from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by
pretending it’s just an apple and nothing more.",en,sword
840,"As soon as it’s born, it burrows into an apple. Not
only does the apple serve as its food source, but
the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution.",en,shield
841,"It ate a sour apple, and that induced its
evolution. In its cheeks, it stores an acid
capable of causing chemical burns.",en,sword
841,"It flies on wings of apple skin and spits a
powerful acid. It can also change its shape
into that of an apple.",en,shield

A nectarous scent wafts from its body, luring in
the bug Pokémon it preys on.",en,sword
842,"Its body is covered in sweet nectar, and the
skin on its back is especially yummy. Children
used to have it as a snack.",en,shield
843,"As it digs, it swallows sand and stores it in its
neck pouch. The pouch can hold more than
17 pounds of sand.",en,sword
843,"It spews sand from its nostrils. While the enemy
is blinded, it burrows into the ground to hide.",en,shield

sand sprays from its nose. If it ever runs out of
sand, it becomes disheartened.",en,sword

out of its sand sac more efficiently.",en,shield

opponents in a single hit, but it also may
forget what it’s battling midfight.",en,sword

Occasionally, it makes a mistake and tries to
swallow a Pokémon other than its preferred prey.",en,shield

charges for it straightaway, leading with its
sharply pointed jaw. It’s very proud of that jaw.",en,sword

extremely sluggish. That’s when Cramorant
swallows it up.",en,shield

flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.",en,sword

forward at speeds of over 100 knots before
ramming prey and spearing into them.",en,shield
848,"It stores poison in an internal poison sac and
secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch
this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows.",en,sword

to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it
can cause a tingling paralysis.",en,shield

chugs stagnant water to absorb any toxins it
might contain.",en,shield

generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly
get particularly hot.",en,sword

them in its coils. Once they’re well-done, it will
voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.",en,shield

about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. It lashes its
body like a whip and launches itself at enemies.",en,sword

its own, this excessively hostile Pokémon also has
large and very sharp fangs.",en,shield

things is to try to punch them with its tentacles.
The search for food is what brings it onto land.",en,sword

when that happens—it knows they’ll grow back.
It’s about as smart as a three-year-old.",en,shield

the grappling moves this Pokémon performs with
its tentacles tremendously powerful.",en,sword

a lonely spirit possessed a cold, leftover cup
of tea.",en,sword

home is a famous piece of antique tableware.
Many forgeries are in circulation.",en,shield

Most pots are forgeries, but on rare occasions,
an authentic work is found.",en,sword

for this Pokémon to come along and pour itself

creatures’ emotions. If you don’t have a calm
disposition, it will never warm up to you.",en,sword

will run away as fast as it can. It prefers areas
without people.",en,shield

emotions near this Pokémon, it will silence
you violently.",en,sword

headaches as a deterrent to the approach
of others.",en,sword

apart by the claws on its tentacle. This Pokémon
is also known as the Forest Witch.",en,shield

produced by people and Pokémon when they
feel annoyed. It thrives off this negative energy.",en,sword

and feasting on the negative energy of the
frustrated occupants.",en,shield

forgiveness, it’s trying to lure opponents in so
that it can stab them with its spear-like hair.",en,sword

woods. Some believe it to have the power to
make crops grow.",en,shield

enhance its muscles, this Pokémon can overwhelm
even Machamp.",en,sword

unfurl, they latch on to opponents, ensnaring

While crossing its arms, it lets out a shout that
would make any opponent flinch.",en,shield

hardened hair. This Pokémon lives for the thrill
of battle.",en,sword

otherworldly energy. The ectoplasm serves as
protection for this Pokémon’s core spirit.",en,sword
864,"Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body
surrounding its soul. You’ll become
stiff as stone if you touch it.",en,shield

can attain this evolution. When this Pokémon’s
leek withers, it will retire from combat.",en,sword
865,"After deflecting attacks with its hard leaf shield,
it strikes back with its sharp leek stalk. The leek
stalk is both weapon and food.",en,shield

of ice in time with its graceful movements.",en,sword
866,"Its amusing movements make it very popular.
It releases its psychic power from the pattern
on its belly.",en,shield

painting. After absorbing the spirit of a Yamask,
the painting began to move.",en,sword

shown the horrific memories behind the picture
carved into it.",en,shield

off rocks. Electric current flows from the tips of
its spines.",en,sword

frigid place. It keeps its head iced constantly to

emotions of others. Males will act as valets for
those they serve, looking after their every need.",en,sword

pouches, this Pokémon is not just satisfying its
constant hunger. It’s also generating electricity.",en,sword

electricity. Compared to its lower body,
its upper half is entirely too small.",en,shield

generates its electricity. It has a hard time
walking around.",en,sword

was able to preserve food with the ice on its
body. It went extinct because it moved so slowly.",en,shield
